Well, I know about Scientology's Clear, but I was wondering if there were evidence that the company was being run by fucking Scilons. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously not.
I don't see where the camera man had an attitude, but perhaps I simply have a higher attitude threshold. In either case, having an attitude is not a crime. 
Your girlfriend *is* a tarp!!
The true reason so many [Atheist](http://point2click.net/images/Godisneat2.jpg) links make front page. 
I did what you see there...
The plan was to wait until they got up close and jump out at them. Believe it or not, wild animals do violent shit when you do that.
What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. But enough talk, have at you!
But, but, but REPORTERS were there!

It's totally on our to-do list.
And even then, only if it was a sexy dream.
Of course, I had to hear what all the fuzz was about. I hadn't listened to Radiohead before downloading In Rainbows, and that album made sure I never will. I couldn't understand the music at all. Maybe it's just me. But I'm with you.
Hmm, it looks like we're on a roll...
In Soviet Russia... eehhhhh...
I can't wait until live uploading of video streams becomes common place for just that reason. Other reasons, not so much.
Mission Accomplished.
No, I think you have it right.
Put down the beer.
Why do people keep naming things skynet? It's bad luck dontcha know.
Uh, yes they are by many people.  Dialects very from region to region, what region do you live in?
would be great if all were. and if his replacement for this case did exactly the same thing.
Pig reminded me of the cops from Duke Nukem. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope he gets put on an assault charge, has to pay for a new camera and gets fired as an example to all.

Well look at you, hanging out in one of his properties...  He not only created a great linkshare but reddit, especially programming reddit (proggit) has a collection of the smartest people I have ever found in a community.
Could have been ESR...
I have an autonomous nuclear weapon carrying my backpack for me. Bastard never gets hassled. Always talks his way into first class too.
Or maybe just wear a shirt with a pointy looking stick on it.
He nearly had a gun drawn on him.
You shoot in RAW because each decompression/process/recompression cycle multiplies the compression noise. RAW is basically saying 'I plan on doing some processing with this, so don't compress it. mm'kay? Thanks'
Yes, but dozens more will be a lot more motivated to learn it. Religion of peace wins again.
The sniper battle is easily in my list of top five boss battles of all time.

Especially `mod_better_than_iis`.
Yeah, I've noticed that the dumbest shit I've said got the most upvotes.

There were commercial Smalltalks for the PC, were there not?  
McCain has voted in support of such matters, and yet in most public places he will speak against it. This is my biggest problem with him. The man endured horrible acts, and yet now he is so much a shell of a man he cannot even stand against it.
Pirated copies or it won't be accepted by the Windows world. newlinechar  newlinechar No, seriously, the main reason Visual C++ is well-known is because it's pirated.  And the main reason it's pirated is because it's well known.  Chicken, meet egg.
If step 2 is still 'Put your junk in that box', I'm going to start having some serious doubts about the Lisp community.
Pierce is awesome.  If you haven't read [TAPL](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/), you should.
Ugh, I never get to the end of the simulation, I always get a blue screen and have to shut my computer down and reboot, does anyone know how to bypass whatever is bsod'ing my computer?
I'm curious.. what do you use APL *for*? Are you paid to write APL code?
Nuremburg was a bit of a farce too. Who was tried for Dresden, Hiroshima, Mers-el-Kebir, the internment of those of Japanese-descent, etc?
Shut up troll.
The scheduler considers everything to be processes, but there are obvious differences in terms of the address space, and special handling for thread synchronization.
Escape velocity was incredible, I think i made myself ill in order to play that over Monday and Tuesday once.
I'm not certain, but I believe that's only available for sites that already use Google as the method of searching the site internally.
Dorf. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar sincerely, stop with the fucking sig already
Then play slower. Remember, it's not the winning, it's the taking part.
&gt;I hate cats newlinechar  newlinechar Wow. It never ceases to amaze me how the anonymity of the internet allows people to just come out and talk about their character flaws.  newlinechar  newlinechar First, reddit has an open pedophile, now this. 
and like someone said, removing a file from the internet is like taking the piss out of a swimming pool.
Podemos! newlinechar  newlinechar Also, how bad-ass would it be to have a president that is capable of communication?
You wouldn't happen to have any evidence for this assertion, would you?  Like a recording of some Israeli military person saying, 'Yeah, we're dropping these bombs on regions in Lebanon where nobody lives on purpose.'  Or anything in that direction?  No?

Edit: no one on reddit has a sense of humour anymore
They sure moosed up!
because you are subscribed o the nsfw subreddit you dumb fuck
I'm actually not sure which has less users: Safari on Windows, or IE on Mac. newlinechar 
Libertarians are like those people who think you really want to hear what they just saw on the discovery channel since they're practically experts on manatees now.
I up-voted you for being insightful then down-voted you for having more then one sentence then up-voted you for bashing on Slashdot!
lol nobody wants to go to philly
im pretty sure they earned that reputation on their own.  Gardenstate - good movie... reputation has existed wayyy before that.
I bust out Civ III all the time and was wondering what everyone else refuses to uninstall after years and years. newlinechar  newlinechar I've also got a bunch of older RPG's like Eye of the Beholder, etc. but I rarely play them before playing something 'newer,' like Balder's Gate.
This is a perfect example of the current problem. This comment makes sense, shows a **different** point of view, so is interesting, but people disagree, so it's being downmodded.
2015.
In the American South, people frequently mix up a lot of important concepts.
So there are actually people in this world that have beat Battletoads. newlinechar  newlinechar LIES!!!
woah woah woah... Jersey's a state?  I thought it was a religion or a state of being or something.  
God must have been using frontpage if that's the html he wrote.
That would just shift the balance to more control for popular redditors.  It still leaves the problem of minority opinions being pushed aside.
For some reason I thought of the animal turkey instead of the country.
&gt;What else have you noticed broken about the comments? newlinechar  newlinechar Some are nonsensical, while others are at odds with my (superior) point of view.  Still others are completely nonsensical to me.
Which doesn't mean that 'Jesus' hasn't massively influenced Western culture over the last two thousand years.
Yeah he backed British Labour over the Conservatives back in 1997, right?
when the dems get into office, will fox news flip and become the 'liberal''news' network?
or that authority should not be blindly followed.
Why not just search for 'database key'?
Actually, that's one of the big things Obama did in the Illinois state senate (sorry to plug him, but it's relevant). newlinechar  newlinechar All police interrogations and confessions must now take place on tape in Illinois.
Hey, you are forgetting a saddle... is **that** the reason for the state of your nuts...? ;)
timecube.com newlinechar  newlinechar wait...no that is the opposite
I think the problem is the music and the childish singing tone. I wouldn't want to watch Teletubbies, even though it's in English, and I wouldn't want to watch this commercial.
If that IS his real name....
That would be a dumb waste of money. Robots are much more cost effective for actual exploration.
Don't forget the friendly
No, I ate his parrot.
Holy shit, they teach *four* languages in your schools? newlinechar  newlinechar To an American, native plus one extra language would be amazing.
I think an affordable 64gb SSD would be the swansong of standard HDDs, of coarse we will probably see 256gb SSDs hitting the market before then.  
I also can't think of another reddit demographic where they would make comments like that and have it be tolerated by the community. Sexism is tolerated, but racism, classicism, ethnocentricism are not. Or maybe they are - but we just don't see as much of them. 
Would you like to learn some political reality?  newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_march newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot newlinechar  newlinechar Conspiracies are frequent and important turning points in history.

What would the Guido People of Africa say?
Wrong. That's not Megatron. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &lt;/geek-sarcasm&gt;
Raytheon has government contracts, it's not actually the government.
You sure you're spelling that right?
I guess Harper can count on not winning the next election. If he is really stupid enough to sign this it will send a big signal to Canadians that he has no back bone. There is no reason Canada needs to sign into this.
Nice find, now the citizens just have to know it is available.   newlinechar  newlinechar 
Not wanting to unsubscribe, but the polluting of my feed reader is making me consider it.
How can you claim that Michael Moore has ever been 'silent'?
if you get bit by one make sure to isolate yourself from your loved ones.
Proof this is a fake, G0d used Perl..... newlinechar http://xkcd.com/224/

I can only assume that this was an attempt to attract females, as herons (and birds in general) go to great lengths to get a mating partner. They are also known to shriek loudly as well. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.heroncam.com/wildlife/breeding.html newlinechar  newlinechar

So, you think if it weren't for ARPANET we wouldn't have world-wide network(s)??? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Does 'CompuServe', 'GEnie' or AOL ring the bell...?
It's one louder.
Alien hoaxes are entertainment, that's what MSNBC does.
Very funny.  I was doing my own research on lolcats recently and came across a very intriguing [documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jDfSqtG2E4). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, if it's old or you've seen it before then go fuck yourself...it's new to me.
If that wandered into my house, I'd keep it for a week or two before handing it over to the zoo... so adorable!  
Heh, I have played and beaten most of the MegaMan games, including 1,2, and 3.  Most people I talk to though, see to assume the series started at 4 (like Star Wars) and don't even know there are earlier titles.
Well, it's certainly not a flaw on the same scale as hating cats, but I think many people would agree that it has some problems. 
Google Westermarck effect.
You need to use the strafe button.
The 'I' in GUI stands for Interface, so it's redundant to say GUI Interface.  That's like saying Graphical User Interface Interface, which would be redundant.  In short, GUI Interface is a redundancy.
Then what the fuck are you doing on reddit?
Maybe you are doubting the wrong person. 
He teaches 'military studies', a discipline not particularly known for its scientific approach or rigor.
you cant run faster, but you could run with a load for a longer distance before tiring.
'shooted?' This is the spelling they teach kids these days?
Also has the most infectious jingle of any videogame ever :P
Tell us something we don't already know.  
Many other states have clauses like that. The Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional, back in the '60s or '70s I think.
Look at my fucking haircut! LOOK AT IT!!
I'm thinking that the video would have included only the worst of what the cop said/did.
The cake is a lie... god is a lie... therefore: god is cake!  Omn nom omn omnipotent....
